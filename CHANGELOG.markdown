# CHANGELOG

fresh doesn't use version numbers so a changelog doesn't quite work.
However we will strive to document breaking changes against their Git SHAs here.
If a breaking change occurs we will attempt to keep a deprecation warning in the code for 1 year.
If you're worried about fresh changing, you can lock the version using `--ref`.

`git log` is your friend.
